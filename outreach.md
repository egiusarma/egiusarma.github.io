During my stay at UC Berkeley, I have been a volunteer
for the Bay Area Scientists in Schools (BASIS) Program, a program that connects UC Berkeley
scientists and engineers with Bay Area elementary students. I have illustrated my research field
to 3rd grade students and I have taught some basic scientific notions such as the concept of
natural selection.Third graders learn about
predators, prey, and food webs using birds as examples.

I have been a volunteer of the 2018 Cal Day Program, an UC Berkeley campus-wide event
where the scientists showcases to a broader audience, different aspects of the research taking
place in the university. I have participated to help lead some hands-on activities for
children such as designing Alka Seltzer rockets and exploring all about air and space.

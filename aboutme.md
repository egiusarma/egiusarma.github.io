# About Me
I am a Flatiron Research Fellow at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) (CCA). My research focuses on developing new algorithms and using machine learning methods in order to study the effect of neutrinos on numerical simulations.
Prior to joining CCA, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](https://www.cmu.edu/cosmology/people/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon University and a Research Affiliate at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](http://cosmology.lbl.gov/directory.html) and [UC Berkeley](http://bccp.berkeley.edu/),  where I worked with professors Shirley Ho and Rupert Croft. Previously I was an INFN research fellow at [University of Rome "Sapienza"](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it) in the cosmology group of Prof. Alessandro Melchiorri. During this period I worked on topics in inflation, modified gravity and axion cosmology and I was a member of Planck collaboration. I received my PhD in 2013 at the [Instituto de FÃ­sica Corpuscular (IFIC)](http://webific.ific.uv.es/web/) and University of Valencia under the supervision of Dr. Olga Mena, working on Neutrino Cosmology. Before this, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Rome "Sapienza" where I obtained my Master's degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

I am a cosmologist working on the interplay between data and theory. I am broadly interested in using cosmological data to learn about the origin, evolution and composition of our Universe. My main research focuses on cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure (LSS) and neutrino cosmology. I am also interested in applying machine learning methods in order to study our Universe.

I was born in Formia, a lovely city in the central southern of Italy. I spent several years living in Valencia (Spain), 1 year in Pittsburgh (US) and two years in Berkeley. I am currently living in New York, US.
